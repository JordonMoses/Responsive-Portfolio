# Responsive-Portfolio #

First created 3 html files to begin crafting the pages. 

The second thing I crafted was the navbar made available through Bootstrap. I edited the text of the navbar and liked the html files in order to navigate to the pages (about, portfolio, contact)

I then found some code that would allow me to make a sticky footer. I included my LinkedIn to add additional context to my page. 

Once I completed that work, I began organizing my pages. I created a container on the index page to house my row(s) and coulmns. This is where i put my portrait and my bio language. I added a 50 px margin at the top and bottom so that the content had some breahting room from the header and footer.
